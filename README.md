#Regression This notebook introduced a few techniques to handle a regression problem.
Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common loss function used for regression problems (different loss functions are used for classification problems). Similarly, evaluation metrics used for regression differ from classification. A common regression metric is Mean Absolute Error (MAE). When numeric input data features have values with different ranges, each feature should be scaled independently to the same range. If there is not much training data, one technique is to prefer a small network with few hidden layers to avoid overfitting. Early stopping is a useful technique to prevent overfitting.
